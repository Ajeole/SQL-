# Employee Salary
A portfolio project on employees' salary.
This repository contains an SQL script for creating and populating tables in an Employees database. 
The script is compatible with Microsoft SQL Server.

## Getting Started

To use this SQL script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the SQL script file.

2. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any other SQL client.

3. Connect to your Microsoft SQL Server instance.

4. Open a new query window and execute the SQL script by copying and pasting its content into the query window.

5. Execute the script to create the database schema and insert sample data.

## Database Structure

The script creates the following tables:

- REGIONS
- COUNTRIES
- LOCATIONS
- DEPARTMENTS
- JOBS
- EMPLOYEES
- JOB_HISTORY

Each table represents a specific aspect of an employee management system, such as regions, countries, departments, jobs, employees, and job history. The tables are connected through foreign key relationships.

## Data Population

The script also includes sample data insertion statements. The INSERT statements populate the tables with some example data to demonstrate the functionality of the database.
